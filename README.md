# README

chiliMD is a user-driven educational platform that enhances open and credible information-gathering, information-sharing, collaborative peer-review, and makes citing references a snap.  Built using Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, PostgreSQL, OAuth, and Chart Kick.

Simply clone this repo, run `rails db:create`, then run `psql chilimd_development < chilimd_backup.sql`.

You may need to brew install minimagick if you do not have it installed locally, or the image thumbnails will not work.

OAuth requires developer app keys from facebook and google.
